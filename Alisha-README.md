# My Lab 6 README

This README demonstrates the Markdown skills I learned while completing Lab 6. GitHub is the perfect place to practice Markdown because it renders the formatting instantly, making it easy to see how headings, lists, tables, and code blocks appear in a real development environment. Using GitHub also helps build good habits for version control and documentation, which are essential skills in cybersecurity and IT.

Overall, working with Markdown in GitHub has been a smooth and useful experience. The syntax is simple, readable, and easy to learn, and GitHub’s preview feature makes it clear how each element will look once published. Creating this README helped me understand how developers organize information and document their work in a clean, professional way.
