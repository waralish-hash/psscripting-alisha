# My Lab 6 README

This README highlights the Markdown skills I practiced while completing Lab 6. GitHub makes it easy to learn Markdown because it instantly shows how headings, lists, tables, and code blocks will look once published. Working in GitHub also helps build strong habits for documentation and version control, which are important skills in cybersecurity and IT.

Overall, using Markdown in GitHub has been a simple and positive experience. The syntax is easy to understand, the preview feature makes formatting clear, and creating this README helped me see how developers organize information in a clean and professional way.
